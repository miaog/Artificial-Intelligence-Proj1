# Search-and-Games-Pacman
This project consists of two parts: Search and Games

### Search
Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. This consists of general search algorithms that are applied to Pacman scenarios.

### Games
In the games part, I have designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, my partner, Matthew Cline, and I implemented both reflex agents and minimax search and tried evaluation function design.
